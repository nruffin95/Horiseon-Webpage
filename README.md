# Horiseon-Webpage
I have optimized and update this websites code to have a better understanding for future projects. Comments were added to both the html and css files. <br>
I also updated the css file to reduce the use of repetative code with multiple selectors targeting the same id's and class. All links inside the html are working along with added alt tags to improve website optimization. <br> 
The Website is now functioning properly but also resembles the customers request along with updated code. <br>
The links to the repo and live page for git hub are as followed.
